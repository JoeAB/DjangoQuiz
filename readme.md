This is just a test project for me getting acquainted with Django. I'm walking through the 
tutorial project found at this link: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/.

As of step 6, I've diverted and started turning this into my own project. Will be making a quizlet
type application. General requirements are below.

General Requirement 1: Users be able to create an account/sign into the application using the base user account system.

General Requirement 2: There should be a home where it's possible to create a quiz, view old quizzes, or select to study individual
questions.

General Requirement 3: Creating a quiz should either allow for the creation of a custom quiz (user picks questions from 
a list) or a randomly generated(they select a category and number and it's generated for them).

General Requirement 4: The finish page is a results that provides a score and saves them for viewing later / possibly compare
scores



Bonus: I might make a math / statistics add on for this at some point to test semi random problems.
